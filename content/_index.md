## Hi ! I'm Augustin, I like data.

I have a versatile profile, with skills ranging from **Data Engineering** to **Data Analysis** with some lighter **Machine Learning** and **Web Development** knowledge. I worked at [BimBamJob](https://www.bimbamjob.fr) for 4.5 years, a french company doing professional integration. I also contributed to other projects like [2tonnes](https://2tonnes.org).

I get easily fascinated by [beautiful](http://feltron.com/FAR13.html) [data](https://periscopic.com/#!/articles/Visualizing-Swedish-Mortality) [visualisation](https://philippschmitt.com/archive/2018/work/roads-to-rome.html) [projects](https://www.nature.com/immersive/d41586-019-03165-4/index.html). Sometimes when I get the time, I like to try and build similar personal projects, with a focus on visualising personal data. 

Below are a few of my project, and hopefully more to come. 

Feel free to send me an email at a.durivault@gmail.com if you want to get in touch :) .
